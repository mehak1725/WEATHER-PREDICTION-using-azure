☁️ Weather Prediction Model using Azure AutoML
This project demonstrates how to build, train, evaluate, and deploy a machine learning model for weather prediction using Microsoft Azure's Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) pipeline.

📌 Project Overview
The goal is to predict weather conditions based on input features using Azure Machine Learning Studio. The project involves creating and managing datasets, running AutoML experiments, evaluating models, and deploying the best model for real-time predictions.

🧰 Tech Stack
Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio

Azure AutoML

Python (optional, for consuming endpoints)

Jupyter Notebooks (optional)

REST API for deployment

📊 Steps Followed
1. Workspace Setup
Created a new Machine Learning workspace on Azure portal.

2. Launch Azure ML Studio
Accessed the workspace using Azure ML Studio.

3. Create Data Asset
Uploaded weather dataset as a tabular dataset into the workspace.

4. Create Compute Instance
Created a compute instance to run AutoML jobs and perform model training.

5. Submit AutoML Job
Configured an Automated ML run with a target column (e.g., temperature or rainfall prediction).
Selected classification or regression as the task based on the dataset.

6. Explain Model
Used built-in interpretability tools to understand feature importance and model behavior.

7. Test Model
Evaluated model performance using standard metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R².

8. Previewing Results
Inspected model explanations and metric charts in Azure Studio.

9. Deploy the Best Model
Deployed the best-performing model as a real-time web service on Azure.

10. Consume the Endpoint
Tested the endpoint using:

Azure’s built-in testing tool

Python script using requests module

🚀 How to Run the Project
Clone this repository (if hosted on GitHub).

Open Azure ML Studio and set up the workspace.

Follow the steps above to recreate the pipeline.

Use the Endpoint URL and API Key for real-time predictions.
